= qbicc

This is the `README` for qbicc.  There's not much here yet but be sure to read link:Overview.adoc[the overview].

Our https://qbicc.zulipchat.com[`Zulip`] chat is a great place to ask questions and get started.

== Building

To quickly build the project, execute `mvn install -DskipTests` in the root.
This will build qbicc using the latest pre-built release of the `qbicc-class-library`.
Adding `-DskipTests` avoids running the integration tests, which take about 15 minutes.

== Class Library

Qbicc uses a customized version of the OpenJDK libraries: https://github.com/qbicc/qbicc-class-library[`qbicc-class-library`]. The class libraries are released as a maven artifact, but if you are developing qbicc
you will eventually want to build your own local version.

Note: *You must clone the qbicc-class-library repository on a case-sensitive file system.*
If you are on macOS, please follow the
https://github.com/qbicc/qbicc-class-library#readme[`instructions for creating a case-sensitive file system on macOS`] before executing the commands below.

[source,shell]
-----
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:qbicc/qbicc-class-library.git
cd qbicc-class-library
mvn install
-----

== Running

To run the driver, first build the project and then use https://jbang.dev[`jbang`] to run it:

[source,shell]
-----
jbang --quiet org.qbicc:qbicc-main:0.20.0 --boot-path-append-file /path/to/main.jar --output-path /tmp/output hello/world/Main
-----

For a step-by-step example, see `examples/helloworld/hello/world/Main.java`


== Running with a locally build Class Library

After building the class library, you can get qbicc to use it simply by adding the
command line argument `--rt-version=17.alpha.0.NNN-SNAPSHOT` (where NNN matches your
local class lib version) to your qbicc invocation. For example,

[source,shell]
-----
jbang --quiet org.qbicc:qbicc-main:0.20.0 --boot-path-append-file /path/to/main.jar --output-path /tmp/output --rt-version=17.alpha.0.NNN-SNAPSHOT hello/world/Main
-----

== JBang cache

When plugins are added or removed, the jbang cache may become inconsistent and result in build errors.
If that happens, add the `--fresh` option to the above command line. Eg: `jbang --fresh ...`
Alternatively, clear the entire cache using:
[source,shell]
-----
jbang cache clear
-----

== Requirements

Please ensure the follow are installed and available on your path:

* LLVM 13
* JDK 17
* Maven 3.6.1+

=== MacOS

To prevent Java versioning errors it is best to install Maven manually rather than with homebrew (see https://maven.apache.org/install.html). The homebrew Maven install has a dependency on Java 16 which may cause Maven to use the wrong version of Java when building qbicc.

The `libgcc_s.dylib` is also required to be available and must be present (or symlinked) to
`/usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.dylib`.

One way to get this library, if it's not already on your system, is to `brew install gcc`
and symlink the file.

For Catalina, it may already be present and the following symlink will resolve the compile
failures
[source,shell]
-----
ln -s /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.dylib
-----

For BigSur, the `brew install gcc` path is likely necessary and following symlink resolves
the issue
[source,shell]
-----
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/11.1.0/lib/gcc/11/libgcc_s.1.dylib /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.dylib
-----
