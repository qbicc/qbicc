= QCC: Object Model Implementation

== Background

=== What is an Object Model?

The Java language defines a number of operations that can be performed
on any non-primitive value. These include:

* Dynamic typechecking
** `instanceof`
** `checkcast`
** must implement interface check in `invokeinterface`
** dispatching to an exception handler
* Dynamic method dispatch
** `invokevirtual`
** `invokeinterface`
* Default hashcode
* Object cloning
* Synchronization
** `monitorenter` and `monitorexit`
** synchronized virtual methods
* Getting the `java.lang.Class` instance for an object
* Various additional reflective operations (field access, method dispatch)

In addition, the memory management subsystem needs to be able to
perform operations such as:
* Identify the runtime type of a heap allocated object to:
** Trace its pointer fields during a GC
** Allow the GC to move an object
* Support heap walking
* ...

All of these operations rely on being able to map from an object
reference to information about the object.  In many systems, an
object reference, ie a pointer whose target is a heap allocated
object, is referred to as an OOP (object-oriented pointer).

Almost universally, the heart of the object model implementation is a
standardized object header which is stored at a fixed offset in the
object instance.

=== Object Model Design Considerations

Object header design is fundamentally a time-space tradeoff. Bigger
headers allow more information to be "close at hand" to allow shorter
instruction sequences for key operations.  Smaller headers reduce the
memory footprint of the program which often improves performance by
increasing locality and reducing GC overheads.

Object headers are usually designed in "word sized" chunks. On a
system with 32 bit pointers, a 4 byte word is the natural unit.  Even
on a 64-bit system, it may still be advantageous to think of object
headers in 4 byte chunks (especially if the header does not contain
any potentially 64-bit pointers).  Since the bulk of non-array heap
allocated objects are expected to contain object references and 32 or
64 bit primitive values, having "empty" bytes between the end of the
object header and the start of the first data field of the object is
usually not useful.

If the target system has alignment constraints for certain operations
(for example, atomic memory operations are more efficient on 8 byte
aligned addresses), then the alignment and size of the object header
need to reflect these constraints.

Similar object model operations are often repeated on the same OOP
within a region of code.  Therefore it is important to represent
primitive object model operations in the compiler's intermediate
representation in a form that enables the compiler to optimize away
redundant operations.  In particular, it is critical that the compiler
understand that most parts of an object header (and the downstream
runtime artifacts derived from header loads such as vtables, itables,
etc) are immutable.  Therefore is is safe to reuse previously loaded
values across function calls and to aggressively schedule these
operations "early" by hoisting them out of loops.

=== Prior Art

Not surprisingly, there is a rich history of object model innovation.

Here are some ideas from prior work that are perhaps less well known
and most relevant to QCC.

==== Type pointers vs type ids

Object headers will contain encoding of the object's runtime type.
There are two choices: a pointer to some type-specific structure
(vtable, VMClass instance, etc.) or an index. The main tradeoff is
that typeIds typically take many fewer bits, while pointers usually
enable slightly faster access to variable sized information. Pointers
are almost always combined with some form of bit-stealing where the
low-order bits of the pointer are used to encode additional
information. 

==== Lock Nursery

Although in principle any object could be locked, it has been observed
that it is possible to make fairly accurate Class-based predictions on
whether or not instances of the Class will be frequently locked. If
instances of a Class are unlikely to be used in locking operations,
the data fields used for "thin locks" can be elided from instances of
the Class. When the predictions is wrong, a slow-path locking sequence
using a "lock nursery" (a side hash table of "fat locks") is
utilized. Some of the typical heuristics are:

* classes that has synchronized virtual methods need thin locks.
* instances of `java.lang.Object` should have a non-inherited thin
lock.

In effect, a `.lock` instance field is introduced into a class (and
inherited by its subclasses) when the class defines a synchronized
virtual method. There is no additional cost for these methods
(vs. having a thin lock at a fixed offset), since the offset of the
`.lock` field is always known statically.  There is some runtime
overhead when a `monitorenter` or `monitorexit` operation is performed
on an object and static type information does not allow the existence
or offset of the `.lock` word to be known statically....the inlined
code sequence has to dynamically acquire the possible offset of the
`.lock` field from the metadata in the object's `VMClass` and check it
for validity before either using it or calling the slow path "fat
lock" path.

The Lock Nursery technique is described by [Bacon, Fink, Grove ECOOP 2002]
and has been adopted by J9 and others.

==== Address-based hashing

Using the "middle bits" of an object's address as its default hash
code is a common technique.  In systems where the garbage collector
may need to move live objects, a common technique is to use two bits
in the object header to encode one of three possible states for an
object "not-hashed", "hashed", "hashed-and-moved".  When an object in
the hashed state is relocated by GC, it is switched to the
"hashed-and-moved" state and its original default hashcode is stored
elsewhere. This introduces complexity in the GC and (depending on
whether the hashcode is stored "before" or "after" the moved object in
memory or in some other side table can have significant implications
for the scanability of the heap and the efficiency of the default
hashcode operation on the subset of objects that have are
"hashed-and-moved".

One weakness of address-based hashing in a system with a
generational garbage collector is that since almost all objects are
initially allocated in a nursery of modest size, there is not a huge
amount of entropy in the initial addressed of objects.  J9 addressed
this by mixing in a "salt" value to the hashcode of objects in the
nursery that was changed after each minor collection.

==== Selector Coloring etc.

Prior work has used the term "selector" as a generalization of message
name when discussing dispatching techniques.  In the context of Java,
a selector is the combination of a method name and method descriptor
(the descriptor encodes the static type signature of a method).

Message dispatching can be viewed as a table lookup: each valid
pair of (receiver dynamic type, selector) is mapped to a unique method
implementation that should be invoked for that pair. A straightforward
implementation of this idea is to construct in some form the full
two dimensional array that is indexed by (typeId, selector).  Usually
this array would be extremely sparse, therefore it is amenable to
various forms of compression and hashing (aka selector coloring).
In the context of QCC where the entire class hierarchy of the program
is known statically, table compression techniques could be applied
without the normal Java complication of dynamic class loading
invalidating the compression algorithm.

However, there are some tradeoffs to consider.  If we cannot rule out
IncompatibleClassChangeErrors, then either (a) we must perform a
`doesImplement` dynamic check prior to the compressed table lookup or
(b) the compressed table must contain enough data to allow the
detection of ICCE and raise the appropriate exception.

==== typeId assignment optimizations

If we use a dense numbering scheme that encodes the `extends`
relationship correctly (tree traversal order), then subclass tests can
be simple range checks.

A dense assignment of subclass ids also enables dense arrays of the
primary derived type specific information (for example vtable style
dispatching, itables, access to VMClass, access to java.lang.Class, etc).


=== QCC Base Assumptions

QCC operates under a strong closed world assumption.  All program
classes are statically available when the program is compiled. This
enables the compiler to apply whole program analysis and generate
optimized data structures to implement method dispatch and dynamic
type checking.

We are biased towards space-efficient object models, even if it adds
compile-time complexity.

We want either a 32-bit or 64-bit object header.

== Potential QCC Object Headers

=== A 32 bit header for QCC

Almost certainly, a 32-bit header implies using a typeId as the
primary runtime type identifier for an object.

A 32-bit header implies using the lock nursery technique to avoid any
thin lock state in the default object header.

We will need to reserve a few (2?) bits in the object header for
use by an eventual GC system.

A 32-bit header may imply using 2 header bits to encode hashing
state and dealing with hashed-and-moved in a moving GC.

If we use a 16 bit typeId, we could access it with a simple load
instruction without any subsequent masking operations.  Any other size
typeId would require a mask or shift operation after the load to
extract the typeId bits for use in subsequent operations. 

If we think 14 bits of default hashcode are acceptable, then a
potentially optimal 32 bit header would contain:

* 16 bit typeId
* 14 bit default hash code
* 2 bits for the GC

=== A 64 bit typeId-based header for QCC

We use 20-24 bits of the header for a type id. This effectively
removes any limitation on supported program size. 

We will need to reserve a few (2? 3?) bits in the object header for
use by an eventual GC system.

We have quite a few bits available for other purposes.  Some
possibilities include:

* We use about 24 bits to store the default hashcode for the object
  (middle bits of its initially allocated address). This avoids some
  complexity when we get to moving GCs. 
* We decide to not use a lock nursery and spend some bits on a thin
lock. We can probably get away with 16ish bits for this, assuming we
still use a side-structure for "fat locks" and store an index into
that structure instead of a full fat lock pointer.
* We still use a lock nursery, but use a few bits in the object header
to encode the offset of the `.lock` word to optimize `monitorenter`
and `monitorexit` bytecodes. 
* We could use a few bits to try to optimize dynamic type checking
operations on arrays (store dimensionality for example). 
* Other stuff...

=== A 64 bit pointer-based header for QCC

The object header is a VMClass pointer with some bottom bits being
stolen for use as a bit field. 

We have to carefully tradeoff the number of stolen bits vs. the
alignment constraints that imposes on the VMClass instances. Probably
we can afford to steal between 4 and 6 bits. Assuming we want to
support a moving GC eventually, we need two bits for the GC itself and
two for addressed based hashing.

We use a lock nursery.

We use address based hashing and hash-and-moved scheme. 


== QCC 0.1 Object Header

Our initial design point is for a compact typeId based header. The
object header common to all heap allocated objects contains:

* A 16 bit `typeId` field that contains the object's typeId.

In the short term, all object monitor operations will be implemented
via out-of-line fat locks.  We will very likely enhance this with a
lock nursery approach for providing 32 bit inline `.lock` words for
reachable classes with synchronized virtual methods.

While we are using the `NoGC` allocator, we can simply use the
object's address for its hashcode with no additional object model
support.

All arrays extend the basic object header by adding a 32 bit `length`
field that contains the length of the array.

Arrays of non-primitives extend the array header by adding a 32 bit
`dimensions` field that indicates the dimensionality of the array
(valid values are between 1 and 255) and a 16 bit `elementType` field
that indicates the type of the base element. To illustrate how these
fields are used, a `String[][][]` would have a `dimension` value of
`3` and an `elementType` that corresponded to `java.lang.String`.

=== Instruction Sequences for Critical Operations

==== invokevirtual

We generate a `vtable` for each class that contains function pointers
to the method to be invoked for each reachable selector of the
class. There is a root `vtable[]` generated in `java.lang.Object.ll`
that is indexed by `typeId` and contains pointers to each class's
`vtable`.  Therefore an `invokevirtual` dispatch is simply three
dependent loads and an indirect call.

```
  # Load the `typeId` from the receiver (%L1)
  %L7 = getelementptr %T.test.InvokeVirtual$Data, %T.test.InvokeVirtual$Data* %L1, i32 0, i32 0
  %L8 = load i32, i32* %L7, align 4, !dbg !24
  # Load the object's vtable for vtable[typeId]
  %L9 = getelementptr [58 x i8**], [58 x i8**]* @qcc_vtables_array, i32 0, i32 %L8
  %LA = load i8**, i8*** %L9, align 8, !dbg !23
  # Load function pointer from vtable[selector]
  %LB = bitcast i8** %LA to %T.struct.vtable-test.InvokeVirtual$Data*, !dbg !33
  %LC = getelementptr %T.struct.vtable-test.InvokeVirtual$Data, %T.struct.vtable-test.InvokeVirtual$Data* %LB, i32 0, i32 1
  %LD = load i32 (i64, i64)*, i32 (i64, i64)** %LC, align 8, !dbg !22
  # Invoke the target function
  %LE = call i32 (i64, i64) %LD(i64 %thr0, i64 %L5), !dbg !21
```

==== invokeinterface

We define an `itable` for each interface that specifies an order for
the reachable selectors that are usable in `invokeinterface` for that
interface type.  Each class that implements the interface will define
its own `itable` that contains pointers to the instance methods of the
class that implement each selector.  For each interface we generate an
`itables[]` that is indexed by `typeId` and contains a pointer to each
class's `itable`. All invalid slots are initialized to an error `itable`
that contains stubs that will throw an `IncompatibleClassChangeError`
if invoked. The presence of these stubs eliminates the need to perform
an explicit check at the `invokeinterface` call site to validate that
the receiver object actually implements the interface.

Therefore an `invokeinterface` dispatch is simply three
dependent loads and an indirect call.

```
  # Load the `typeId` from the receiver (%L1)
  %L1 = inttoptr i64 %L0 to %T.java.lang.Object*, !dbg !27
  %L2 = getelementptr %T.java.lang.Object, %T.java.lang.Object* %L1, i32 0, i32 0
  %L3 = load i32, i32* %L2, align 4, !dbg !24
  # Load the object's itable from itables[typeId]
  %L4 = getelementptr [58 x %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I*], [58 x %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I*]* @qcc_itables_array_itable-test.InvokeInterface$I, i32 0, i32 %L3
  %L5 = load %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I*, %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I** %L4, align 8, !dbg !23
  # Load function pointer from itable[selector]
  %L6 = getelementptr %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I, %T.struct.itable-test.InvokeInterface$I* %L5, i32 0, i32 2
  %L7 = load i32 (i64, i64)*, i32 (i64, i64)** %L6, align 8, !dbg !22
  # Invoke the target function
  %L8 = call i32 (i64, i64) %L7(i64 %thr0, i64 %L0), !dbg !21
```

==== instanceof/checkcast (of a class)

We have assigned typeIds via a postorder traversal of the class hierarchy. Therefore an object `o` is a subclass of `C` exactly when `C.minTypeId <= o.typeId <= C.maxTypeId`.

We will use the following trivial class hierarchy to illustrate the cases:

```java
class A {}
final class B extends A {}
class C extends A implements I {}
interface I {}
```
We can implement this test with a single branch by using unsigned comparisons by doing the test:
`o.typeId - C.minTypeId <= (C.maxTypeId - C.minTypeId)`
As `C.minTypeId` and `C.maxTypeId` are compile time constants, we can get a tight 4 instruction sequence: load, add immediate, unsigned compare, branch.

```java
static boolean test1(Object a) { return a instanceof A; }
```

Compiles into:

```
B0:
  # test for a != null
  %L0 = icmp ne i64 %p0, zeroinitializer, !dbg !69
  %L1 = inttoptr i64 %p0 to %T.java.lang.Object*, !dbg !73
  br i1 %L0, label %B1, label %B2, !dbg !67
B1:
  # load typeId from a
  %L2 = getelementptr %T.java.lang.Object, %T.java.lang.Object* %L1, i32 0, i32 0
  %L3 = load i32, i32* %L2, align 4, !dbg !71
  # subtract `A.minTypeId` from typeId
  %L5 = sub i32 %L3, 20, !dbg !78
  # unsigned compare to A.maxTypeId - A.minTypeId
  %L6 = icmp ule i32 %L5, 2, !dbg !77
  br label %B2, !dbg !70
B2:
  %L4 = phi i1 [ %L6, %B1 ], [ false, %B0 ], !dbg !76
  ret i1 %L4, !dbg !74
```


If `C` is a leaf class (no live subclasses), we can do a simple load, cmp eq, branch.

```java
static boolean test2(Object a) { return a instanceof B; }
```

Compiles into:

```
B0:
  # test for a != null
  %L0 = icmp ne i64 %p0, zeroinitializer, !dbg !83
  %L1 = inttoptr i64 %p0 to %T.java.lang.Object*, !dbg !87
  br i1 %L0, label %B1, label %B2, !dbg !81
B1:
  # load typeId from a
  %L2 = getelementptr %T.java.lang.Object, %T.java.lang.Object* %L1, i32 0, i32 0
  %L3 = load i32, i32* %L2, align 4, !dbg !85
  # compare to B.typeId
  %L5 = icmp eq i32 %L3, 22, !dbg !91
  br label %B2, !dbg !84
B2:
  %L4 = phi i1 [ %L5, %B1 ], [ false, %B0 ], !dbg !90
  ret i1 %L4, !dbg !88
```

==== instanceof/checkcast (of an array)

There are a variety of cases to cover. Some can be done with fast
inline implementations, others we may want to implement with
out-of-line helpers as they are less common, potentially more
complex and may need out-of-line helpers defined anyways (to support
optimized arraycopy implementations for compatible Reference array types).

The cases to cover are:

* Testing for a 1 dimensional primitive [] is analogous to testing
  for a final class.  Equality compare for the typeId of the array
  class.

* Testing for various forms of Reference array that are all encoded
  using a single primary ReferenceArray `typeId` and a secondary
  `dimensions` and `elementType` `typeId`.
** Testing for a k-dimensional primitive arrays.
** Testing for a k-dimensional Object[]
** Testing for a k-dimensional array of class `C` or interface `I`.

TODO: Finish implementation and fill in above with generated LLVM IR sequences.

==== instanceof/checkcast (of an interface)

We generate a byte array for each interface that is indexed by `typeId` and contains
`0` or `1` values to indicate whether or not the class implements the interface.

```java
static boolean test3(Object a) { return a instanceof I; }
```

Compiles into:

```
B0:
  %L0 = icmp ne i64 %p0, zeroinitializer, !dbg !96
  %L1 = inttoptr i64 %p0 to %T.java.lang.Object*, !dbg !101
  br i1 %L0, label %B1, label %B2, !dbg !94
B1:
  %L2 = getelementptr %T.java.lang.Object, %T.java.lang.Object* %L1, i32 0, i32 0
  %L3 = load i32, i32* %L2, align 4, !dbg !99
  %L4 = getelementptr [74 x %T.struct.typeIds], [74 x %T.struct.typeIds]* @qcc_typeid_array, i32 0, i32 %L3, i32 2, i32 0
  %L5 = load i8, i8* %L4, align 1, !dbg !98
  %L7 = and i8 %L5, 1, !dbg !106
  %L8 = icmp eq i8 %L7, 1, !dbg !105
  br label %B2, !dbg !97
B2:
  %L6 = phi i1 [ %L8, %B1 ], [ false, %B0 ], !dbg !104
  ret i1 %L6, !dbg !102
```

== Future QCC Object Model Ideas

This section is an attempt to capture as many of the possible future
design options that have been raised in chat/discussion.  Not all of
these ideas are mutually compatible or fully formed, so caveat lecotr!

=== Method Dispatch

Use selector indexed tables for both invokevirtual and
invokedispatch.  Each method selector would have its own dispatch
table that would be indexed by typeId.

Explore other options for invokeinterface:

* save data space by using searched itables instead of directly indexed
  itables. In some previous systems, searched itables have been
  combined with a move-to-front cache to optimize for classes that
  implement a large number of interfaces.
* generate customized interface dispatching stubs as in
  [Alpern et al OOPSLA 2001]
* Use perfect hashing or some other hash-based compression scheme to
  improve the space usage of directly-indexed interface tables.

A key question for using many of the more space efficient dispatching
schemes is determining whether or not we can statically eliminate the
need to dynamically check for `AbstractMethodError` and
`IncompatibleClassChangeError` as part of the dispatching sequence.

=== Hashcodes / Garbage Collection

It is likely we will want to allow moving garbage collectors at some
point in the future.  When we do, we will need to add the necessary
support to the object header (GC-specific bits and support for
maintaining defualt hashcodes as objects are moved).

=== Compressed pointers

Having compressed (ie 32-bit) pointers can yield significant heap size
reductions for programs that have a max heap of a small number of GB
(between 4GB and 32GB typically depending on assumptions on object
alignment). Combining compressed heap pointers with ASLR probably
means keeping more or more base pointers in the `VMThread` object. We
might be able to control the logical heap layout enough to allow the
basepointer to be derived by masking the VMThread object (for example,
the VMThreads are all allocated in the lowest `N^k` bytes of the heap
and the heap is 2^k aligned. Therefore we can obtain the base pointer
of the heap simply by masking the low k bits of the VMThread ptr.
